# 🌱 FocusFarm

An indie farming simulation game designed to help you cultivate focus while you play. Currently in development as an evolution of a university project, FocusFarm invites you to experience the peaceful rhythm of farm life while exploring a beautifully crafted 2D [Sprout Lands](https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-asset-pack) world.

## 🚜 About

FocusFarm is a 2D farming simulation game built using Java and Swing. Drawing inspiration from focus apps like [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc) and combining them with classics like [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net), the game creates a unique experience where virtual farming activities help reinforce real-world focus habits.
